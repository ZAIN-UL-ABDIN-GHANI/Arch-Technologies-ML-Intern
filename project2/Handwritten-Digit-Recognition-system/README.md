# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Welcome to the **Handwritten Digit Recognition** project! This web application uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0–9). Users can draw a digit on a canvas, and the app predicts the number in real time with confidence scores.

## Project Overview

This project leverages a **CNN model** trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The app is built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **TensorFlow\.js**, allowing it to run entirely in the browser for fast and interactive predictions.

Users can draw digits on a canvas and instantly view predictions along with confidence scores, all without any server-side computation.

---

## Features

* **Digit Drawing Interface**: Draw digits (0–9) on a canvas.
* **Real-time Prediction**: Model predicts digits instantly in the browser.
* **Confidence Score**: Displays confidence level for the prediction.
* **Responsive Design**: Works on desktops and mobile devices.
* **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between themes for better visual experience.
* **Fully Offline**: Runs completely in the browser with TensorFlow\.js.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+** (for training or modifying the model)
* **Node.js & npm** (optional if using TensorFlow\.js locally)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.git
cd Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Convert Model to TensorFlow\.js Format (Optional)

```bash
tensorflowjs_converter --input_format keras model/digit_recognition_model.h5 js/model_files
```

### 4. Open `index.html`

No server setup needed. Open the HTML file directly in any modern browser.

---

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Draw a digit (0–9) on the canvas.
3. Click **Predict** to view the prediction.
4. The **predicted digit** and **confidence score** will be displayed instantly.
5. Click **Clear** to reset the canvas for another input.

> **Note**: On mobile devices, after clicking **Predict**, scroll to the result section to see the output.

---

## How the Model Works

1. **Dataset**: Trained on **MNIST**, containing 60,000 images of handwritten digits.
2. **Model Architecture**: Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image classification.
3. **Training**: Model achieves high accuracy on MNIST test data.
4. **Deployment**: Converted to **TensorFlow\.js** format and loaded in the browser for real-time predictions.

---

## Future Applications

* **Mobile Digit Recognition**: Deploy on mobile devices for real-time digit recognition.
* **Educational Tools**: Help students practice writing and recognizing digits.
* **Financial Automation**: Digitize handwritten invoices, checks, or forms.
* **AI Research**: Extend the model to multi-language handwriting recognition.
